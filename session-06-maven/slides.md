# Maven
## A typical Java project needs

- organizing source coda
- organizing tests
- JARs to add to the class path
- commands to run to start locally
- commands to test
- commands to deploy

All of those problems can be solved by Maven.

## What is Maven?

- build automation tool
- dependency management tool
- project management tool

## Project management with Maven

Maven provides a consistent project model

- metadata about the project
- helps start developing
- helps test
- helps build and deploy

## Convention over configuration

Maven has an opinion about how a java project should be, so you dont have
to worry about it or do any extra configurarion (as long you stick to the default).

## The Project Object Model

`pom.xlm` where you can specify things on you java project.

- project metadata
- declarative format
