## The classic "Hello world" program

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }

}
```
# My Notes:

## Primitive data types (values)

- int (whole numbers) 4 bytes -> 32 bits
- double (decimals) 8 bytes -> 64 bits
- float (shorter decimals) 4 bytes -> 32 bits
- long (longer whole numbers) 8 bytes -> 64 bits
- short (shorter whole numbers) 2 bytes -> 16 bits
- byte (even shorter whole number) 1 bytes -> 8 bits
- char (single character) 2 bytes -> 16 bits
- boolean (true or false)

## Non primitive data types (references)

- String (sequence of characters)
- Array (collection of similar data types that are indexable)
- Class (blueprint for creating objects) - data structures that has behaviours and attributes
- Interface (collection of abstract methods) - that must be implemented by the classes that implements that interface
- Enum (set of named values)
- Record (a "carrier" of data)
