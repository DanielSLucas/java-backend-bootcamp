# Time complexity

- O(1) -> constant time complexity (e.g. getting the first element of a given array)
- O(n) -> Linear time (e.g. search through all elements of a given array)
- O(n^2) -> Quadractic time complexity (e.g. search through all elements of a given two dimensional array)
- O(log n) -> Logarithmic time complexity (e.g. binary search)
