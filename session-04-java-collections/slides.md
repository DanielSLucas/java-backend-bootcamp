# Time complexity

How much time it takes to solve a problem.

- O(1) -> constant time complexity (e.g. getting the first element of a given array)
- O(n) -> Linear time (e.g. search through all elements of a given array)
- O(n^2) -> Quadractic time complexity (e.g. search through all elements of a given two dimensional array)
- O(log n) -> Logarithmic time complexity (e.g. binary search)

# Space complexity

How much space it takes to solve a problem.

- Dynamic proggraming -> save the results for some set of arguments, to avoid
doing the processing again (e.g. caching or memoization). This processe decreases
the time complexity but increases the space complexity, and this is an acceptable
trade-off since space is easier to expand the space than the computing power.
