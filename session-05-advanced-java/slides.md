# Functional programming

-> Functional programming is: composing code using pure functions.

-> Functions contains imperative code withing itself, to help us write a more
declarative code.

-> Pure functions are functions that only manages the parameters and no external
variables/data.

-> Methods are different from functions because:
  - they belong to a class
  - they can/might access class member variables
